- Add `http://` to links so other apps _(e.g.: WhatsApp/Telegram)_ can generate a link preview.
- Upgraded 8 dependencies! Including [flutter_svg](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) that caused the release to be delayed [(dnfield/flutter_svg#479)](https://github.com/dnfield/flutter_svg/issues/479)
- Fix `CircularProgressIndicator` weird size in About page.
- Add share **subject** parameter, useful for example, email app.
- :globe_with_meridians: Added open on [**web**](https://waktusolat.web.app/).
- Fix some Flutter **button deprecation** including `OutlineButton`, `RaisedButton` & `FlatButton`. [Flutter notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yohSuYrvyya5V1hB6j9pJskavCdVq9sVeTqSoEPsWH0/edit?usp=sharing).

- Change `Accept this location` to `Set this location` in locationChooser dialog.
- [CODE] Upgraded [flutter_local_notification](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) to `4.0.1`. Looking at the [changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications/changelog#400), I hoping there is some increase in **notification scheduler performance.**
- Others (may) not documented.

<ChangelogHeader version="1.13.91-hotfix2" date="19 February 2021" githubSlug="1.13.91-hotfix2+43" />

- Custom fork [hijri](https://github.com/iqfareez/hijri_date) packages to make it more Malaysian friendly ([Huh?](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/releases/tag/1.13.91-hotfix2%2B43#:~:text=so%20that%20tak%20guna%20sgt%20istilah%20mcm%20arabic%20tu)). Thanks to Aqil Mohd for the idea.
- Reverted to the **good old** [**mpti906**](https://mpt.i906.my/api/prayer/sgr-1) API (yes again hahaha), no longer use [JAKIM](https://www.e-solat.gov.my/index.php?r=esolatApi/takwimsolat&period=month&zone=SGR01) API because very often downtime and affected the user experience. Thanks to Aqil Mohd again.
- Notification threshold until rescheduled reduced to **two days** (Previously three days).

<ChangelogHeader version="1.13.89-hotfix" date="19 February 2021" githubSlug="1.13.89-hotfix+42" />

- Fixed **time conversion** conflict when converting 12:00 to epoch, and later affected UI view. It supposed to be converted to 12pm but it was converted to 12am (hshshhs :joy:). Closes [#49](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/49). Thanks to [butitik](https://github.com/butitik).
- Change notification **naming convention** to Malay to make it consistent with the UI, however channel name not (yet) effected. Related to [#45](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/45). Thanks to Aqil Mohd.

<ChangelogHeader version="1.13.87" date="17 February 2021" githubSlug="1.13.87+41" />

- Added [geocoding](https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding).
- Prayer time zone is now **detected in app**. This should fix the issue [#28](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/28) where some location is wrongly detected.
  - Caveat: Geocoding plugin uses **Google Play Service API**, so, devices like Huawei may not be supported.
  - Previously, user location is sent to `mpti906` API for getting JAKIM code. _(Introduced in ver. [`1.3.15`](#ver-1315---29-september-2020))_
  - Honorable mention to Mr. Aizal Manan who contribute ideas in fixing this issue.
- :sparkles: Prayer time data now fetched directly from [e-solat JAKIM](https://www.e-solat.gov.my/) API. No more [mpti906](https://mpt.i906.my/) API.
- :tada: Added **Qibla compass** feature. Thanks to [flutter_qiblah](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_qiblah) and its example (I take most of the code from there hehe üëÄ)
- Bump `compileSdkVerison` and `targetSdkVersion` to **`30`** (Android 11 support)
- :truck: Change naming convention to Malay nomenclature [#45](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/45). However, notification name not effected (or the notification channel will be messed up).

<ChangelogHeader version="1.12.76-stable" date="27 January 2021" githubSlug="2.2.8+36" />

- :zap: **Fixed app not responding** issue. No automatic notification scheduling when open app or changing theme. It will reschedule back after 3 days on app reopening. Issue [#31](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/31) solved.

  - Notification gets its own **dedicated settings** :gear:. Including troubleshooting option if needed
    - Added ability to **limit the notification scheduling**. By default, the app will schedule notification until the end of the month. This process is sacrificing performance.

Commit reference: [df47ffa](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/commit/df47ffaa9b358016b0cbdd65f8163ac84224e379)

  - When developer mode is already enabled, dialog will shown in the first long press.

- :lipstick: Added space between URL and comma in feedback page, some apps will treat the comma is part of URL. Issue [#31](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/issues/31). Reference commit [60c5e9c](https://github.com/mptwaktusolat/app_waktu_solat_malaysia/commit/af1fd4e1ecf11b6618b773890ef45c69cef41f71)

[#31](https://github.com/iqfareez/App-Waktu-Solat-Malaysia/issues/31)
  - However, there still a few noticeable slowdowns but it not as severe as the previous release (except when you change theme). Users at least can now change settings (am/pm or show other prayer time) without triggering the notification scheduler again.
- :bell: App will remind users at **00:05 on the first day of the month** to open the app for scheduling notification. _(As the API only provide prayer data for the current month, notification scheduling for the next month can't be done.)_
